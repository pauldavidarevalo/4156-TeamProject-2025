## End-to-End Testing


**Full Workflow Test**  
This test exercises the full workflow of the client application:
1. Uploading log files to the backend service.
2. Processing the logs through the API.
3. Collecting results and generating internal data maps.
4. Generating visual graphs from the processed data.

---

### Test Objective
- Verify that the client correctly interacts with the backend APIs.
- Ensure the uploaded logs are processed as expected.
- Confirm that the client correctly constructs the internal data structures for reporting and graph generation.

---

### Test Inputs
- **Log File(s):**
    - `sampleLogs/fullDayLog1.log`
    - `sampleLogs/fullDayLog2.log`
- **Client Parameters:**
    - `clientId`: `x4156`
  

---

### Steps Performed
1. **Start the Client:** Launch the client program locally. Use: 

   mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=dev.coms4156.client.LogProcessorClient"
2. **Enter Client ID** x4156
3. **Enter API Key** "API key"

    At this point if there were any previous logs for that client ID, they are
    reset
4. **Enter Path to log file** sampleLogs/fullDayLog1.log
2. **Upload Logs:** The client then uploads the log file to the backend. And prints
   a response upon success.

    The user is prompted to add another log path. Add sampleLogs/fullDayLog2.log
- <img src="/images/End-to-End-2.png" alt="alt text" />

    Type "quit" to exit the log upload loop
4. **API Interaction:**
    - The client calls the backend APIs to process logs.
   
4. **Collect Results:**
    - The client constructs internal data maps from API responses.
    - These maps are printed to the console for verification.

5. **Visualization:**
    - Graphs generated by the client are visually inspected to ensure they match the data trends from the logs.
- <img src="/images/End-to-End-3.png" alt="alt text" />
- <img src="/images/End-to-End-4.png" alt="alt text" />
- <img src="/images/End-to-end-5.png" alt="alt text" />

### Expected Results
- API calls return successful status codes (`200 OK`).
- Data maps produced by the client match the counts and timestamps from the uploaded log file.
- Visual graphs correctly reflect the underlying data.
