# 4156-TeamProject-2025 team The Java Beans
This is the shared repo for 4156 SWE Team Project Fall 2025. This README will provide documentation on the development 
and deployment of the Log Processing Service. This service involves a Spring Boot application that processes Apache log files, stores 
them in a database, and provides analytics and security endpoints.

## Building and Running a Local Instance
Make sure to run and install the following:
- Maven 3.9.5: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
    - Download and follow the installation instructions (preferably download the bin zip file or bin tar gz file)
    - Set the bin as described in Maven's README as a new path variable by editing the system variables on Windows
- JDK 17: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
    - Download JDK 17 to have the best compatibility with the code developed in the repo
- IntelliJ IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows
    - You should use IntelliJ for optimal performance, but other IDEs like Visual Studio Code should be alright
- PostgreSQL Database (required for JPA/Hibernate):
    - Install PostgreSQL 15+ and create a database named `logprocessor`
    - Update `application.properties` with your database credentials
- Download the PMD Source Code Analyzer: https://pmd.github.io/
- Clone the repo using the command "git clone https://github.com/pauldavidarevalo/4156-TeamProject-2025.git"
- Go into the root folder and run the command "mvn compile" to compile the project with Maven
- You should then run the command "mvn spring-boot:run" to actually run the application
- You will then be able to make requests at 127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080
- If you have issues making POST multipart requests, create a free Postman account here: https://www.postman.com/
- Download the Desktop Agent for Postman so that you can make requests locally
- Create a new workspace so that you can invoke different requests
- You can then paste the URL of the endpoint you are invoking in the search bar and select the type of request made
- If you wish to run the style checker, you can run the command "mvn checkstyle:check" to see the code style results on the command terminal or the command "mvn checkstyle:checkstyle" if you wish to generate the report.
- Note: This project was run on a Windows computer, so the instructions might be a little different for Mac computers.

## Running Tests
The unit tests are located in the "src/test/java/dev/coms4156/project/logprocessor" directory and
cover many different branches for the LogEntry model, LogService, and controller classes. You should first
compile the project by going into the root directory and running the command "mvn compile" here. You
should then run the command "mvn clean test" to run the updated suite of tests. After running these tests, you should
check that all tests are successfully working (no assertion errors, missing imports, etc.). You can then look at the new
JaCoCo report by running the command "mvn jacoco:report" and going to the "src/target/site/jacoco" folder. You can then
look at the overall branch coverage by clicking index.html and opening it in a browser (Google Chrome works best).

## Endpoints
We will go over the endpoints associated with the LogController, AnalyticsController, and SecurityController classes to 
cover the inputs, outputs, and overall functionality for these methods. Any request that does not follow the correct 
endpoint structure will cause an HTTP 400 Bad Request response. If the service is not running (the commands "mvn compile" 
and "mvn spring-boot:run" are not used), there will be generic error message saying "This site can't be reached 127.0.0.1 
refused to connect." on the page. As a side note, there is an option to check the "Pretty-print" box so that the JSON response looks well-formatted.

## Style Checking Report
This project uses the Maven checkstyle tool to check the style of the code and also have style checking reports that
contain audits of the code style. The command needed to invoke this checkstyle tool is "mvn checkstyle:check" if you
want to see this information in the terminal. If you want to see a report, the command "mvn checkstyle:checkstyle"
should be used.

## Branch Coverage Report
This project uses JaCoCo to perform branch coverage analysis by looking at all possible logical branches
in the code and evaluating the total percentage of branches covered by the unit tests. The "src/target/site/jacoco"
folder contains different files associated with the different class branch coverage metrics. You can look at the overall
branch coverage by clicking index.html and opening it in a browser (Google Chrome works best).

## Static Code Analysis
### PMD Source Code Analyzer Guides
1. https://pmd.github.io/
2. https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_rules_java.html

### PMD Source Code Analyzer Instructions
1. Download pmd-dist-7.17.0-bin.zip
2. Extract the zip-archive, e.g. to C:\pmd-bin-7.17.0
3. Add folder C:\pmd-bin-7.17.0\bin to PATH
4. Navigate to "4156-TeamProject-2025" directory
5. Execute: `pmd check -d src -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f text -r pmd-report.txt`

### PMD Source Code Analyzer Note
There might be a few minor warnings that might appear for auto-generated JPA annotations.
However, we have considered these warnings to not be that important to the code style and structure.

## Continuous Integration Report
This repository uses GitHub CI/CD Workflows with separate `.yml` files for feature and main branches. Access the results by clicking on the Actions tab:
- Click workflow → latest run → "Unit Test" job
- Feature Branch Workflow: Runs on feature branch pushes
- Main Branch Workflow: Runs on main branch pushes/pull requests

## Tools Used
These are all the tools used for code development and deployment for this application:
- Maven Package Manager
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD Workflows)
    - This is enabled via the "Actions" tab on GitHub.
    - There are two workflows where one workflow focuses on the feature branch while the other workflow focuses on the main branch.
    - The first workflow "Feature Branch" runs a Maven build and all unit tests to make sure the code builds on the feature branch pushing code changes.
    - The second workflow "Main Branch" runs a Maven build and all unit tests to make sure the code builds on the main branch whenever there is a push or pull request.
- Spring Boot Application
  - Spring Boot serves as a web framework that facilitates queries to web endpoints.
  - Spring Boot autoconfigures the Apache Tomcat server, sets up JSON serialization, and manages REST API functionality.
- Spring Data JPA/Hibernate
  - Spring Data JPA converts the LogEntryRepository interface into full database CRUD operations.
  - Spring Data JPA also allows for custom queries through the analytics endpoints.
- PostgreSQL
  - PostgreSQL is used to facilitate data persistence and storage with a database.
- Checkstyle
    - Checkstyle is used for code style reporting and enforcement.
- PMD Source Code Analyzer
    - PMD does static analysis of the Java code before generating a report in a txt file.
- JUnit
    - JUnit tests get run automatically as part of the CI pipeline.
- JaCoCo
    - JaCoCo was used to generate code coverage reports.
- Postman
    - Postman was very useful for API testing, especially when someone needs to make PATCH requests to the service.
